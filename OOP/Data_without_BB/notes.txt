Mode is a more accurate measurement for the weight
Animal seems tentative about climbing down the ladder 
(stayed on the weighing bridge for over half an hour)
- Maybe an angled ladder would help the animals move on and off

Animal got stuck on top of the ladder because it was spreading its body downwards (paws remained 
on top of the door)

Animal seemed scared, removed with homecage

explored well. preference for run pod. speeds up when door3 actuates.
problems with door1 getting stuck and eventually coming loose from servo. 
repositioned and reduced friction on joint with cable cover.

- The raspberry pi became unresponsive after a reset, needed to come to the VU to manually restart
- Changed Openscale setting (readings every 120 ms)
- Changed code (weigh animal for 20 seconds instead of 8)

- Long white got stuck in the homecage â€“ it apparently jumped over the servo door after activating
the OpenScale beam break (the animal was at the homecage and MODE was 3)
-fixed and changed door1 code so it gets itself unstuck when closing.


- the maze was restarting as soon as the animal was ending the trial(the door1 would open and close 
rapidly without enough time for the animal to return to homecage). 
- made it quite difficult for the animal to be picked up
