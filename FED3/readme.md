## This is the FED3 library (beta)
The goal of this library is to automate most of the housekeeping functions of [FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3) behind the scenes and let the user focus on writing the behavioral control. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3_library/wiki) for documentation on how to use the library.   This library is in development, please report bugs using Issues. 

## Installation instructions
### 1. Install the FED3 library from the Arduino IDE <br>
Search for the FED3 libary in the Arduino library manager and install the latest version.
